Description:
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.



Solution:
function high(input) {
    // Split the string into words
    const words = input.split(' ');

    // Helper function to calculate the score of a word
    const wordScore = word =>
        word.split('').reduce((sum, char) => sum + (char.charCodeAt(0) - 96), 0);

    // Find the word with the highest score
    let highestWord = '';
    let highestScore = 0;

    words.forEach(word => {
        const score = wordScore(word);
        if (score > highestScore) {
            highestScore = score;
            highestWord = word;
        }
    });

    return highestWord;
}

// Examples
console.log(high("abad")); // Output: "abad"
console.log(high("the quick brown fox")); // Output: "quick"
console.log(high("what time are we climbing up the volcano")); // Output: "volcano"
