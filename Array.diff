Description:
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]


Solution:
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    // Filter out elements in a that are present in b
    return a.filter(item => !b.includes(item));
}

// Examples
console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2], [1])); // Output: [2]
console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2])); // Output: [1, 3]
